# Cyan
Home Automation API for the server side.

###Introduction
Cyan came too when I moved into my first apartment after college. Lighting was poor so I bought some stringed lights, ducked taped them to the ceiling and had to plug them in to the outlet in the farthest possible location from the entrance. 
So I would often stumble in the dark trying to find exactly where the outlet was so that I could connect the lights. I wanted to be able to turn my lights on and off from the comfort of my phone and laptop.

Now I could have written a simple quick solution for this lighting problem, but I ran into another problem it was the middle of the summer, and I absolutely needed an aircondition.
Boston not only gets freezing cold in the winter, but its summers are Hot and Humid. 
and so I got my self a window unit. But the problem with the window unit was that it was super old, 
used a lot of electricity and I could never get the temperature of the room to be comertable it was just always too cold or not cold enough. 
and this is where cyan really came too. 

I wanted to create a system where I could quickly plug in different types of homemade IOT devices and 
control them freely from different locations (i.e. My cellphone, laptop, and even the internet in general), or even automate their behavior. 
But most importantly I wanted it to be sexy, intuitive and easy to use. I also wanted this project to be built around security.

###Description
This is Cyan's server side software. What this specific repo entails is the api that controlls all and the web interface too tag along.


###Clients
Web Interface - (this client is built into this project look into the folder...)

###Licensing: GNU AGPL v3.0
The reason I choose to license it under AGPL v3.0 is because I wanted people to publicly post their improvements. That is the requirement under this licensing. 
I want this project to become something of a collection of people sharing their work from hardware solutions to home issues all the way to the software automation :).
This way others with some general knowledge of technical things can jump in and implement these themselves.
